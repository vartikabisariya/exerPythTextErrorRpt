## Fork & Clone this repository

* We did this in a previous assignment. Instructions are here: https://github.com/cmcntsh/exerGitPractice
* This can also be done directly in VSCode
  * Create a new folder on your machine where you want to put this repository if you don't already have one you want to use.
  * Copy the Clone or Download path for this repository from GitHub.
  * In VSCode from the command pallette (Ctrl-Shift-P) run Git: Clone
  * Paste the path into the path field which pops up
  * Select your new folder you created on your machine
  * A new folder for the repository with the repository files should be in the folder you selected showing in the Explorer window in VSCode on the left side.

## Create a .py file

* In VSCode navigate to your repository folder. 
  * File - Open Folder
* Create a python script called error_report.py

## Extract text files

* Extract the files contained in the text_files.zip.
* Move them to a folder called `original_files` inside the folder where you intend to complete this assignment.

## Watch Tutorial

* Follow along with Python tutorial: Python Script to Generate an Error Report from Text Files (38 min): https://youtu.be/Nvyd6eipXfQ
* When you're done make sure you save your file.

## Push your updated file to your GitHub repository

* This can be done in VSCode.
  * In VSCode click on the Source Control button.
  * You should see the files that had changes. (Mine has the original file which shows an M next to it and a new file which says checkpoint in the name. You really only need to push the original file, but if you push both it shouldn't hurt anything.)
  * Hover over the changed file. Click the + sign to stage the change.
  * Enter a commit message in the message field and click the checkmark to commit the change.
  * Click on the 3 dots for more actions and select Sync. This will push the updated file to your GitHub repository.
  * Submit the link to your GitHub repository on Canvas.
